Hello ! 
My name is Eduardo Torres I am currently a Junior in Data Science with a minor in mathematic. My favorire class at BU so far has been DS310, I really enjoyed learning about data structures and learning the language SQL. Also Professor Ladenheim is really cool ! 

To end this a fun fact about me is that I am left handed !
